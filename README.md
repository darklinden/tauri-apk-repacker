# Apk Repacker (Tauri + Vanilla TS)

Somebody (a Muggle) asked me to make a tool to repack APKs. I thought it would be a good opportunity to try out [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/).

## What is this?

This is a tool that unpack an apk file, modifies the package name, app name and icon, and then repackages it, keeping it with the same VasDolly channel.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
